1. Introduction 
We have developed a Food Ordering System as a web-based application to make the food 
ordering process easy, fast, and user-friendly. This system allows customers to view food items, 
place orders online, and helps restaurants manage orders efficiently. The project is created as part 
of our Web Development semester project using basic and modern web technologies. 
The purpose of this project is to understand how real-world web applications work and how 
front-end and back-end technologies are integrated to solve daily-life problems. 
 
2. Objectives of the Project 
The main objectives of this project are: 
 To provide an easy online platform for ordering food 
 To reduce manual order handling 
 To save time for both customers and restaurant staff 
 To learn practical implementation of web development concepts 
 To design a responsive and user-friendly website

3. Scope of the Project 
The scope of the Food Ordering System includes: 
 Displaying fast food items such as burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. 
 Allowing users to select food items and add them to cart 
 Placing orders online 
 Managing food menu and orders (admin side – basic level) 
This project is suitable for small restaurants, cafes, and fast-food outlets. 
 
4. Problem Statement 
Traditional food ordering methods are time-consuming and can lead to errors due to 
miscommunication. Customers have to wait in long queues or make phone calls to place orders. 
Our Food Ordering System solves these problems by providing an online platform where users 
can order food easily with just a few clicks. 
 
5. Proposed Solution 
The proposed solution is a web-based Food Ordering System where: 
 Customers can view the food menu online 
 Customers can select items and place orders 
 The system automatically records orders 
 Admin can manage food items and orders 
This system improves efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.
